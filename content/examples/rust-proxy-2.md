## From Hello World to Proxy

### Aside (Vim Frustrations)

I use [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) for completion, which has always been great for Go so I decided to use it for Rust too. What I didn't realize is [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go), was doing _a lot_ of work too. Trying to get autocompletion, which I think is _super_ helpful for learning a new language, has fairly easy, but docs and `go-to-def` has been harder. Still working on it, will update.
