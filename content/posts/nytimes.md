Developers I follow on Twitter announce their new positions like rock stars. Well, I am not a rock star. Instead, I am a guy that writes a blog that no one reads and writes code that no one _wants_ to read. That's ok. I started a new job this week at The New York Times. I'm a software engineer on their delivery engineering team. It's a bit different than what I have been doing, but I think I can really harness my passion for easy-to-use and reliable dev tooling and cloud infra. 

## My Week
Best. First. Week. Ever. In spite of the COVIDA19 outbreak, I totally fan boi'd out all over the New York Times. I had to fly home from New York two days early, but I was glad I got three days there. 

I only got a couple photos because we were asked not to take photos in the building. I took one from out front: 
![photo of the New York Times building at 620 8th Avenue, NY, NY](NYT-photo.png)

and one looking down what I _think_ is 8th Avenue.

I really am not sure what their plans are for me. Obviously I will be doing the things that I love to do: find problems for engineers and customers then build and/or configure tools to make things better, but that's pretty broad. I _do_ know that I will be working remotely full time. I'll fly to NY a few times a year. 

Wish me luck!

I'll surely keep you all up to date as I find out what I do for a living.
