Bring on the much excite!

## New Job Week!

![T-mark](/T-mark.png#floatleft)
he New York Times is my new employer! (Hence my fancy text formatting. ;) ) I love that Some developers I follow on Twitter announce when they get new jobs like rock stars. Well, I am not a rock star. Instead, I am a guy that writes a blog that no one reads and writes code that no one _wants_ to read. 
I'm ok with that. I started a new job this week at The New York Times. I'm a software engineer on their delivery engineering team. It's actually a number of smaller teams that build tools for feature devs and handle cloud infra, HA, and fault tolerance. It's a bit different than what I have been doing, but I think I can really harness my passion for easy-to-use and reliable dev tooling. I am excited to be a little closer to the "how" and not necessarily the "what." Best. First. Week. Ever. In spite of the COVIDA19 outbreak, I totally fan boi'd out all over the New York Times. I had to fly home from New York two days early, but I was glad I got three days there. I only got a couple photos because we were asked not to take photos in the building. I took one from out front.

and one looking down what I _think_ is 8th Avenue.

I really am not sure what their plans are for me. I will be doing some of the things that I always do, the ones that I love to do: search out pain points for engineers and customers then build and/or configure tools to make things better, but that's pretty broad and there are a lot of ways to do it. What I  _do_ know is that I will be working remotely full time. I have my home office all set up and it is sweeeet. Maybe I'll show a pic in another post. You can just smell the productivity when you walk in the room. Some other good news is that I'll get to fly to NY a few times a year for various activities. Overall, I am thinking it's pretty amazing!

Wish me luck!
I'll surely keep you all up to date as I find out what I do for a living.
