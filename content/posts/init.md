Hey! Let's get started. 

I can never think of the clever things to say online so let's just go. I am building my brand. Started a company and plan to create some interwebz content! I have tried a blog a few time, but I kept writing about random stuff. Wait a sec! There is something that I write _a lot_ `code`. :)

I plan to post my thoughts on various tech related topics and produce some reference designs and examples of things that may be helpful. I write a lot in Go and I love it so you'll be seeing a fair amount of Go fanboy action. On that front, if you are into Go, checkout [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net)
