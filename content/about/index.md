## Hi, I'm Guy

I am an aspiring technologist and leader in Denver, CO. I love software. I love designing it, implementing it, teaching it and breaking it. Most of the time, I work with other engineers to solve the problems that keep them from doing their jobs as well as they can. I build tools that enable them to work more quickly and in a repeatable way. I am passionate around doing things right from the beginning by way of cloud native best practices. This includes concepts like observability as a requirement and designing fault tolerant maintainable systems. For more detail, see my [LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/guygrigsby/).

I love to ride my bike out under the blue and play Magic: The Gathering when the sun goes down.
